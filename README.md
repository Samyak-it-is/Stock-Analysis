# Stock Analysis of Major US Banks (2006-2016)

This project analyzes the historical stock performance of six major US Banks - Bank of America, CitiGroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo - from 2006 to 2016. It utilizes Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks, and YFinance for data acquisition, manipulation, and visualization.

# Project Goals:

Analyze historical stock data (closing and opening prices) to identify trends and patterns.
Compare the performance of the six major banks over the ten-year period.
Visualize the impact of significant financial events on stock prices.
Create both static and interactive visualizations for insightful exploration.
Libraries Used:

### NumPy: Numerical computing library for efficient data manipulation.
### Pandas: Data analysis and manipulation library for creating dataframes.
### Matplotlib: Basic plotting library for creating static visualizations.
### Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
### Plotly: Interactive visualization library for creating dynamic charts and graphs.
### Cufflinks: Connects Plotly to Pandas Dataframes for seamless integration.
### YFinance: Python library for downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance.

# Data Analysis:

This project focuses on analyzing the closing and opening prices of the six bank stocks. It aims to uncover trends, identify patterns, and understand how major financial events impacted their stock prices during the 2006-2016 period.

# Visualization:

The project utilizes various libraries to create both static (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and interactive visualizations (Plotly, Cufflinks). These visualizations will help in:

Highlighting trends in stock prices over time.
Comparing the performance of different banks.
Visually representing the impact of financial events.
